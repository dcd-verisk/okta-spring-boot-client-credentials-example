# Sample Spring Boot OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Examples with Integrations with Claimx and Okta

Below are the instructions to run the sample Spring Boot OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Examples with Integrations with Claimx and Okta.
This project is a copy of the original project [okta-spring-boot-client-credentials-example](https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-client-credentials-example)

The main aim of this project is
to demonstrate the integration of Claimxperience with Okta as the source of authentication for Webhooks using OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials.

## OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials With Spring Security
 
This example app shows how to implement the client credentials grant with Spring Boot and Spring Security 5.

Please read [How to Use Client Credentials Flow with Spring Security](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2021/05/05/client-credentials-spring-security) to see how this app was created.

**Prerequisites:** HTTPie, [Java 11](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) and an [Okta Developer Account](https://developer.okta.com).

> [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/) has Authentication and User Management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Okta's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users and roles in any application.

### Getting Started

The repository contains three sub-projects:

- `/secure-server` - a simple test server
- `/client-webclient` - a client built using the new WebClient
- `/client-resttemplate` - a client build using the deprecated RestTemplate

To run the sample app, the first step is to configure an Okta OIDC app for all three of the projects. Then, you can run the simple server (which has one endpoint at root). With the server running, you can run either or both of the clients. The clients demonstrate how to use the client credentials grant with Spring's WebClient and RestTemplate in Spring Security 5.

Before you begin, youâ€™ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com) and run `okta register` to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run `okta login`. 

Navigate a shell to the `/secure-server` sub-project. Run `okta apps create`. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit. Choose **4: Service (Machine-to-Machine)** and press **Enter**. Select **1: Okta Spring Boot Starter**.

The `secure-server/src/main/resources/application.properties` should look like the following (with you own values for the issuer, client ID, and client secret.
```properties
okta.oauth2.issuer=https\://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id={yourClientID}
okta.oauth2.client-secret={yourClientSecret}
```

### Add a Custom Scope to Your Authorization Server

Because the custom scope `mod_custom` is used in a `@Preauthorize` annotation, you need to add this custom scope to your Okta authorization server. Run `okta login` and open the resulting URL in your browser. Sign in to the Okta Admin Console. You may need to click the **Admin** button to get to your dashboard.

Go to **Security** > **API**. Select the **Default** authorization server by clicking on **default** in the table.

Select the **Scopes** tab. Click **Add Scope**.

Give the scope the following **Name**: `mod_custom`.

Give the scope whatever **Display Name** and **Description** you would like, or leave it blank. Click **Create** to continue.

### Test Client Credentials with Spring Boot

Start the server from the `secure-server` directory.
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The values above can be used to fill in the necessary values in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file in **both** of the client directories.

`src/main/resources/application.properties`
```properties
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-id={yourClientId}
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-secret={yourClientSecret}
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.authorization-grant-type=client_credentials
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.scope=mod_custom
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.okta.token-uri=https://{yourOktaUri}/oauth2/default/v1/token
spring.main.web-application-type=none
```

Open a shell and navigate to either of the client sub-project directories. Run the client.
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## Exposing your Secure Server

During the development phase, webhooks are hard to test because they require a public URL.
You can use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server to the internet.
However, some companies have restrictions on using ngrok. If you can't use ngrok, you can deploy your server to a cloud provider like Heroku or AWS.

Here are some instructions for exposing your server with ngrok:

1. Install ngrok by following the instructions on their [website](https://ngrok.com/download).
2. run `ngrok http 8081` to expose your server to the internet.
3. Copy the `https` URL that ngrok provides and use it in the Claimxperience webhook configuration.

## Configure Claimxperience's Webhook (Company Endpoint) settings

In Claimxperience, you can configure a webhook to send notifications to your server.
To do this, you need to create a new Company API and configure the webhook settings.

> By this point, you should have the following:
>
> * The **URL of your server** (either exposed with ngrok or deployed to a cloud provider)
> * The **client ID** and **client secret** of your Okta app
> * The **token endpoint** of your Okta authorization server
>   * This is usually `https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token`
> * The custom **scope** you added to your Okta authorization server
> * This example uses `mod_custom`

1. Log in to Claimxperience and go to the **Instance admin** page, then the **API** settings.
2. In the Company endpoint section, fill in the following fields:
   * **Endpoint URL**: The URL of your server
   * **Client ID**: The client ID of your Okta app
   * **Client Secret**: The client secret of your Okta app
   * **Token Endpoint**: The token endpoint of your Okta authorization server
   * **Scopes**: The custom scope(s) you added to your Okta authorization server. These are separated by spaces.
3. Test the webhook by clicking the **Test** button. You'll see a success message if everything is configured correctly.
   - example responses:
     - Example 1: 
       - Server response: Invalid Credentials
       - Status: CANCELLED
     - Example 2:
       - Status code: 404
       - Response body: `Tunnel fff2-192-74-128-125.ngrok-free.app not found`
     - Example 3:
       - Status code: 200
       - Response body: `{"request":{"eventType":"TEST"},"status":"received"}`
   - The response status and body will be what is returned by your server.
4. Modify the events that trigger the webhook by toggling the switches in the **Events Triggers** section.
5. Save the settings once you're done.
